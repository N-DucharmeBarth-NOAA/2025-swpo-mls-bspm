            Bayesian data analysis is about more than just computing a posterior distribution, and Bayesian visualization is about more than trace plots of Markov chains. Practical Bayesian data analysis, like all data analysis, is an iterative process of model building, inference, model checking and evaluation, and model expansion. Visualization is helpful in each of these stages of the Bayesian workflow and it is indispensable when drawing inferences from the types of modern, high dimensional models that are used by applied researchers.},

              can be calculated using an estimate of spawners per spawner, but for chondrichthyans, most studies have used annual reproductive output (b) instead. This is problematic as it effectively assumes all juveniles survive to maturity. Here, we propose an updated r

              max

              max
              values occur in species with low age at maturity and low annual reproductive output. Our results indicate that chondrichthyans that mature relatively later in life, and to a lesser extent those that are highly fecund, are less resilient to fishing than previously thought.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            The adoption of the Precautionary Approach requires providing advice that is robust to uncertainty. Therefore, when conducting stock assessment alternative, model structures and data sets are commonly considered. The primary diagnostics used to compare models are to examine residuals patterns to check goodness-of-fit and to conduct retrospective analysis to check the stability of estimates. However, residual patterns can be removed by adding more parameters than justified by the data, and retrospective patterns removed by ignoring the data. Therefore, neither alone can be used for validation, which requires assessing whether it is plausible that a system identical to the model generated the data. Therefore, we use hindcasting to estimate prediction skill, a measure of the accuracy of a predicted value unknown by the model relative to its observed value, to explore model misspecification and data conflicts. We compare alternative model structures based on integrated statistical and Bayesian state-space biomass dynamic models using, as an example, Indian Ocean yellowfin tuna. Validation is not a binary process (i.e. pass or fail) but a continuum; therefore, we discuss the use of prediction skill to identify alternative hypotheses, weight ensemble models and agree on reference sets of operating models when conducting Management Strategy Evaluation.},

              The Beverton–Holt length‐based mortality estimator has received widespread use primarily due to its applicability in data‐limited situations. The mean length of animals that are fully vulnerable to the sampling gear can be used to estimate total mortality from basic growth parameters and a known length at first capture. This method requires equilibrium conditions because the mean length of a population will change only gradually after a change in mortality. In this study, we derive the transitional behavior of the mean length statistic for use in nonequilibrium conditions. We investigate conditions affecting the reliability of the Beverton–Holt results and then develop a new procedure that allows a series of mortality rates to be estimated from mean length data representing nonequilibrium conditions in multiple years. We then examine an assessment of goosefish
              Lophius americanus
              that was criticized for its use of the Beverton–Holt estimator under nonequilibrium conditions. Using data from the 1963–2002 National Marine Fisheries Service annual fall groundfish surveys off the northeastern United States and assuming a single change in total mortality, we used the maximum likelihood method to estimate that the total mortality of goosefish in the southern assessment region increased from 0.31 to 0.60 per year in 1977. Estimates of the new mortality rate made three or more years after the change were relatively stable and only ranged from 0.55 to 0.71 per year, while estimates from the standard Beverton–Holt approach ranged from 0.37 to 1.1 per year. The results for goosefish in the northern assessment region showed that total mortality changed from 0.14 to 0.29 per year in 1978 and then to 0.55 per year in 1987. The new nonequilibrium estimator allows a change in mortality to be characterized reliably several years faster than would occur with the use of the Beverton–Holt estimator.},

              that, in the absence of demographic data, would indirectly allow one to identify species and populations at elevated risk of extinction and their associated recovery potential. We undertook a comparative life‐history analysis of 199 species from three taxonomic classes: Chondrichthyes (e.g., sharks;
              n
              = 82), Actinopterygii (teleost or bony fishes;
              n
              = 47), and Mammalia (
              n
              = 70, including 16 marine species). Median
              r
              max
              was highest for (and similar between) terrestrial mammals (0.71) and teleosts (0.43), significantly lower among chondrichthyans (0.26), and lower still in marine mammals (0.07). Age at maturity was the primary (and negative) correlate of
              r

              r
              max
              in chondrichthyans and mammals, evidence of an association in teleosts was equivocal, and fecundity was not related to
              r
              max
              in fishes, despite recurring assertions to the contrary. Our analyses suggest that age at maturity can serve as a universal predictor of extinction risk in fishes and mammals when
              r
              max
              itself is unknown. Moreover, in contrast to what is generally expected, the recovery potential of teleost fishes does not differ from that of terrestrial mammals. Our findings are supportive of the application of extinction‐risk criteria that are based on generation time and that are independent of taxonomic affinity.},

              The maximum intrinsic rate of population increase (
              r
              max
              ) represents a population's maximum capacity to replace itself and is central to fisheries management and conservation. Species with lower
              r
              max
              typically have slower life histories compared to species with faster life histories and higher
              r
              max
              . Here, we posit that metabolic rate is related to the fast–slow life history continuum and the connection may be stronger for maximum metabolic rate and aerobic scope compared to resting metabolic rate. Specifically, we ask whether variation in
              r
              max
              or any of its component life‐history traits – age‐at‐maturity, maximum age, and annual reproductive output – explain variation in resting and maximum metabolic rates and aerobic scope across 84 shark and teleost species, while accounting for the effects of measurement temperature, measurement body mass, ecological lifestyle, and evolutionary history. Overall, we find a strong connection between metabolic rate and the fast‐slow life history continuum, such that species with faster population growth (higher
              r
              max
              ) generally have higher maximum metabolic rates and broader aerobic scopes. Specifically,
              r
              max
              is more important in explaining variation in maximum metabolic rate and aerobic scope compared to resting metabolic rate, which is best explained by age‐at‐maturity (out of the life history traits examined). In conclusion, teleosts and sharks share a common fast–slow physiology/life history continuum, with teleosts generally at the faster end and sharks at the slower end, yet with considerable overlap. Our work improves our understanding of the diversity of fish life histories and may ultimately improve our understanding of intrinsic sensitivity to overfishing.},
